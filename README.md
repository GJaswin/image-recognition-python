# Simple Image Recognition Model in Python
## Using Tensorflow, Keras and Scikit

### Steps to Run:

1. Clone the repo  
   ```terminal
    git clone "https://github.com/GJaswin/image-recognition-python/"
    ```
2. (Optional) Create a Python Virtual Environment  
   ```terminal
   python -m venv /path/to/venv
   ```
3. Install the requirements  
   ```terminal
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4.  To execute the python notebook `img_recognition.ipynb`, create a Jupyter Notebook server  
   ```terminal
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. To execute without Jupyter, just run the `img_recognition.py` file with Python  
   ```terminal
   python img_recognition.py
   ```
